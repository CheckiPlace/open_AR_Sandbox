    "- use a rectangular box, ideally with semitransparent (frosted) or opaque walls.\n",
    "- position the kinect and projector in a central position over the box. the closer they are together the better!\n",
    "- make sure the kinect is perfectly horizontal (=parallel to the floor of the box)\n",
    "- the higer the distance between the sandbox and the sensor/projector the better! the distance should be at leat 1-1.5 times the longest dimension of your box! Don't worry if the sandbox does not cover the entire field of view of the kinect, the resolution will still be more than good enough in the end!\n",
    "- adjust the keystone of the projector so that the egdes of the image are orthogonal. \n",
    "- adjust the position of the sandbox (or the projector/kinect) that the projected image is parallel to the box edges and covers the sandbox completely.\n",
    "- set the projection mode that the image is not mirrored or flipped when you look down at the sand from the front of the box.\n",

    "2. now adjust the z-range sliders to define the top and bottom of the box. pixels outside the range as well as invalid pixels that the kinect does not recognize atre white.  If possible you should set it up that the (z_max - z_min) is equal to the shorter horizontal dimension of the box.\n",
    "3. adjust rot_angle to make the edges of the box in the image parallel to the edges of the real box. Make sure the image is not upside down.\n",
    "4. adjust the left x_lim slider to cut away everything that is left of the box boundary. \n",
    "5. do the same for the top edge by adjusting the right y_lim slider.\n",
    "6. now align the top left corner of the image with the top left corner of the sandbox by adjusting x_pos and y_pos\n",
