##  Introduction
Augmented Reality Sandboxes are a great tool for science outreach and teaching due to their intuitive and interaction-enhancing operation. Recently AR Sandboxes are becoming increasingly popular as interactive exhibition pieces, teaching aids and toys.

AR Sandboxes consist of a box of sand that can be freely sculpted by hand. The topography of the sand is constantly scanned with a depth camera and a computed image is projected back onto the sand surface, augmenting the sandbox with digital information.

However, most of these common AR Sandboxes are limited to the visualization of topography with contour lines and colors, as well as water simulations on the digital terrain surface. The potential for AR Sandboxes for geoscience education , and especially for teaching struc- tural geology, remains largely untapped.

For this reason, we have developed open-AR-Sandbox, an augmented reality sandbox designed specifically for the use in geoscience education. In addition to the visualization of topography it can display geologic subsurface information such as the outcropping lithology, creating a dynamic and interactive geological map. The relations of subsurface structures, topography and outcrop can be explored in a playful and comprehensible way.

## Features

* compatible with most AR Sandbox builds
* subroutine for calibration and alignment of depth image, sand surface and projection â€¢ versatile model creation with the powerful GemPy library
* open-source under LGPL v3.0 license
* fully customizable color map, contours and fault line visualization
* one-click export of the current topographic and geologic map as vector graphics
* supporting MacOS and Linux
* projection of legend and additional information

The open_AR_Sandbox as well as GemPy are currently under heavy development and we are expecting a major release in late Summer 2019, bringing to you: 

* Microsoft Windows support
* Tutorials and Documentation to help you develop your own modules
* GemPy optimization for (much!) higher framerates
* module for seismic wave modelling in the sandbox
* on-the-fly modification of the geological model (layer dip, thickness fault throw, etc.)
* ...


## Requirements
You will need: 
* Microsoft Kinect (we tested the first and second generation kinect with a usb adapter, but every kinect compatible with the pykinect drivers will likely work)
* Projector
* A box of Sand


Mount the kinect and projector facing down vertically in the center above of the box. The optimal distance will depend on the size of your sandbox and the optics of the projector, from our experience a distance of 150 cm is well suited for a 80 cm x 100 cm box. 
More details on how to set up the kinect and projector can be found in the `calibrate sandbox.ipynb` notebook.

## Installation 
First of all you will need a a healthy Python 3 environment. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). In addition to some standard Python packages, you will need a specific setup dependent on the Kinect version you are using. In the following we provide detailed installation instructions.

### Standard packages

The standard packages 

```conda install numpy pandas jupyter notebook scipy panel scikit-image matplotlib```

```pip install numpy pandas jupyter notebook scipy panel scikit-image matplotlib```

Now download or clone this repository [open_AR_Sandbox](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/open_AR_Sandbox) from github.

### Kinect V2

(Tested on Windows 10). First, **install the current** [Kinect SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=44561) **including drivers**. You can use the software bundle to test the connection to your
 kinect, before you continue.

To make Python and the Kinect SDK communicate, install the related [PyKinect2](https://github.com/Kinect/PyKinect2) wrappers which can be easily installed via:

```pip install pykinect2```

Unfortunately, the configuration of PyKinect2 needs to be adjusted to work on a 64 bit System.  Therefore, edit the
 _Lib/site-packages/pykinect2/PyKinectV2.py_ file, go to line **2216** and comment it:

```python
# assert sizeof(tagSTATSTG) == 72, sizeof(tagSTATSTG)
```

Add the following lines below:

```python
import numpy.distutils.system_info as sysinfo
required_size = 64 + sysinfo.platform_bits / 4
assert sizeof(tagSTATSTG) == required_size, sizeof(tagSTATSTG)
```

### GemPy

To use implicit geological models inside the sandbox, go to [GemPy](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy),
clone or download the repository and follow the Gempy Installation instructions.

## Getting started
So now the necessary software is installed and (hopefully) running and you have set up your Sandbox with a projector and a kinect, it is time to calibrate your sandbox.
The calibration step is necessary to align your sandbox with the kinect as well as with the projected image. 

Navigate to the Folder `/notebooks/tutorials` and follow the instruction in the `calibrate sandbox.ipynb` notebook. 
If everything goes right you will end up wit a calibration file that you can use for your Sandbox setup.

The next (and most exciting) step is to make the sandbox run and actually showing some geology: the `run geologic model.ipynb` notebook will walk you through the necessary steps.
